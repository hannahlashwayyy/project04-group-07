The project showcases the development of a full-stack AI-powered data application focused on diabetes health indicators. 
It integrates data cleaning, machine learning, and data visualization, utilizing the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset, which includes demographic, lifestyle, and medical history information. 
The application features a Flask backend and an interactive HTML/JS frontend, allowing users to explore data through a diabetes predictor tool. 
The dataset underwent significant preprocessing, transforming the target variable into a binary format and normalizing features to enhance model performance. 
After experimenting with various machine learning models, an ADA model was chosen for deployment, resulting in an application that can predict diabetes risk based on user inputs.

Two professional dashboards created in Tableau delve into the relationship between health factors and diabetes prevalence. 
The first dashboard examines the impact of BMI on diabetes status, revealing that diabetic individuals typically have higher BMIs and poorer self-rated health compared to non-diabetics. 
The second dashboard highlights the influence of socioeconomic factors, such as income and education, on health outcomes, indicating that higher income and education levels correlate with better health ratings and lower diabetes prevalence. 
Overall, the project emphasizes the critical role of machine learning and data visualization in understanding diabetes risk and informs public health strategies by providing accessible insights through an interactive web application.
